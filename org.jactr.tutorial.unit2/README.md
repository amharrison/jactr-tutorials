# Unit 2: Perception and Motor Actions in ACT-R

## ACT-R Interacting with the World

This unit will introduce some of the mechanisms which allow ACT-R to interact with the world, which for the purposes of the tutorial will be experiments presented via the computer.  This is made possible with the addition of perceptual and motor modules which are now an integrated part of the system.  It is a set of modules for ACT-R which provides a model with visual, motor, auditory, and vocal capabilities as well as the mechanisms for interfacing those modules to the world.  The default mechanisms which we will use allow the model to interact with the computer i.e. process the visual items presented, press keys and move and click the mouse.  Other more advanced interfaces can be developed, but that is beyond the scope of the tutorial.
