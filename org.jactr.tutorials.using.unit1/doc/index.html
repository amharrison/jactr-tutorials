	<h1>jACT-R for ACT-R Modelers (Part 1)</h1>
	<p>This is quick tutorial intended for knowledgable modelers to
		introduce them to the jACT-R side of things. This will not cover how
		to build models, rather how projects are set up, models executed, and
		tools used. Nor will this be an introduction to the jACT-R xml syntax.
		It is verbose, and you'll pick it up quick. Besides, a new, cleaner
		and more concise syntax is forthcoming.</p>

	<h2>Basic Differences</h2>
	blah..

	<h2>Project Layout</h2>
	<p>In order to maintain executability across different environments
		and platforms, jACT-R relies upon a strict project layout (derived
		from OSGi/Java best practices). The first element to consider is
		project naming. Java convention is to use reverse url to allow
		back-tracking to a projects source. You need only do this if you want
		to release your models or code.</p>
	<img alt="Project layout" src="images/layout.png" width="25%"
		height="25%" align="right">
	<p>
	<ul>
		<li><em>models</em> : folder for your models
		<li><em>java</em> : folder for custom java code
		<li><em>configuration</em> : folder for items that must be
			accessible on your classpath
		<li><strong>Plug-in Dependencies </strong> : auto generated
			dependency container
		<li><strong>JRE System Library </strong> : what Java environment
			your project needs
		<li>doc : folder containing this info (not required)
		<li>libs : folder for your required libraries (required only if
			you have libs)
		<li><em>META-INF</em> : folder for the meta information required
			to run the underlying Java system. Developers only in here.
		<li><em>runs</em> : folder that contains date and time stamped
			folders of your model runs
		<li><em>build.properties</em> : meta file for how to package and
			export your project.
		<li><em>plugin.xml</em> : meta file describing contributions to
			the jACT-R, Eclipse, or OSGi runtimes. Developers only.
	</ul>
	</p>

	<h2>Editor</h2>
	<img alt="context hint" src="images/hints.png" width="25%" align="left"
		hspace="5">
	<p>
		Open up the model file <em>models/org.jactr.tutorials.using.unit1/addition.jactr</em>.
		Take some time to read through this model file. It is liberally
		commented, highlighting some of the editor's cababilities and
		explaining the layout of the model file.
	</p>
	<p>This is the original Lisp tutorial unit 1 addition model. The
		original lisp is in the comments. Feel free to poke around. Try out
		the editor navigation, code integration, and content completion. The
		Eclipse editor tools also support a wealth of existing, common tools
		like: compare, revert, local history, source revision integration,
		bookmarking, and tagging.</p>

	<h2>Running</h2>
	<p>
		Once you have a model, you need to set up the environment in which it
		will actually run. This includes things like what types of interfaces
		will it be hooked up to, what instruments will be analyzing the model,
		what information should be sent back to the IDE, etc. All of this is
		saved in a <em>run configuration</em>.
	</p>
	<p>
		First, through the menu, go to <strong>Run</strong>-<strong>Run
			Configurations...</strong>. In the dialog that popped up, you select "Tutorial
		1 - Addition Probes" under the jACT-R Run listing on the left.
	</p>

	<h3>Main Tab</h3>
	<img src="images/rncfg_main.png" width="50%" align="middle">
	<p>The main tab allows you to specify which project you are working
		with and then select the model you'd like to run (check box). The
		aliases to the right of the model selection allows you to instantiate
		multiple copies of the model at one time, each with a unique name.</p>
	<br>

	<h3>Instruments</h3>
	<img src="images/rncfg_inst.png" width="50%" align="middle" hspace="5">
	<p>Instruments are pieces of code that can be attached to a model
		to passively monitor it. They are not meant to change behavior at all.
		In this circumstance, we are using the ModelRecorder. This tool
		generates code for the model at the start and stop of a model run.</p>
	<br>
	<br>

	<h3>CommonReality</h3>
	<img src="images/rncfg_cr.png" width="50%" align="middle" hspace="5">
	<p>CommonReality is the interfacing middleware that jACT-R uses to
		interface arbitrary or simulated devices. These are generally
		contributed by experiment builders. If your model makes use of any of
		the perceptual modules, there must be at least on CommonReality sensor
		configured.</p>


	<br>

	<h3>Start/Stop</h3>
	<img src="images/rncfg_start.png" width="50%" align="middle" hspace="5">
	<p>At times is can be necessary to specify some bootstrap code. The
		start/stop runnables are instances of java.lang.Runnable that will be
		executed just before the models start running, and immediately after
		the last one finishes. This is useful for setup and cleanup processes.</p>

	<br />
	<h3>Tracing/Logging</h3>
	<img src="images/rncfg_trace.png" width="50%" align="middle" hspace="5">
	<p>This tab controls what information is reported back to the IDE
		by the runtime. Each tracer provides a description of what it does.
		You can also choose to direct that information to the IDE, to file
		(for playback), or both. Finally, you can optionally turn on the
		runtime's debug tracing (developers only).</p>

	<br>
	<h3>Run configurations</h3>
	<p>
		As you can see, the run configuration encapsulates all the basics
		required to run the model. Why don't you click on <strong>Run</strong>,
		and let's see what happens.
	</p>



	<h2>Inspecting Running Models</h2>
	<p>The IDE should have asked you to switch perspectives to the
		JACT-R run perspective. This layout is designed specifically for
		examining model runs. The most obvious component is the log viewer:</p>
	<img src="images/logView.png" width="50%" align="middle" hspace="5">
	<p>The log viewer is segmented into rows by model time, and columns
		by the log stream. The drop-down menu in the upper right allows you to
		filter which streams you are interested in seeing. Selecting a row
		will then display all the log messages for that cycle in the lower
		text region. You may notice that as you select time rows, other
		elements of the IDE are updated automatically. (check preferences for
		options)</p>
	<img src="images/confBufferView.png" width="30%" align="middle"
		hspace="5">
	<p>For each recorded cycle, the tracers also provide the cycle's
		conflict set as well as all the buffer contents. These views are
		linked to the selection in the log viewer.</p>

	<h2>File Locations</h2>
	<p>
		Every model run occurs in its own date and timestamp folder under <em>runs/</em>.
		If you look there now you will see your run's folder. Inside of it is
		all the data that was generated. In this case it's just start/stop
		folders which contain the full versions of your model before and after
		the run. These were generated by the Model Recorder instrument enabled
		on the Instruments tab.
	</p>

	<h3>Exercise</h3>
	<p>Why not modify the current run configuration so that it runs
		multiple instances of the addition model?</p>

	<hr>
	<h1>jACT-R for ACT-R Modelers (Part 2)</h1>
	<p>Now that you've been exposed to the basic tools, we're going to
		introduce some more advanced usages and additional tools.</p>

	<h2>Runtime Tools</h2>
	<h3>Probe Viewer</h3>
	<p>
		This time, run the launch configuration <em>Tutorial 1 - Addition
			Probes</em>. This run configuration includes the ProbeViewer in the
		Tracing/Logging portion (configured by <em>configuration/org.jactr.tutorials.using.unit1/baselevel.xml</em>),
		the model is slightly modified to include a declarative learning
		module. If you look at the Probes tab, you'll see the baselevel
		activations plotted over time.
	</p>
	<img src="images/probeView.png" width="50%" , align="middle" />
	<p>
		The probe view can be configured to listen to numeric parameter values
		of almost anything in the model: model, chunktypes, chunks,
		productions, links, buffers, modules, and extensions. More information
		on using the probe viewer can be found <a
			href="http://jact-r.org/node/65" target="new">here</a> and <a
			href="http://jact-r.org/node/72" target="new"> here</a>. (check
		preferences for additional options)
	</p>
	<h3>Exercise</h3>
	<p>A useful trick is to include a probe that attaches to the
		retrieval module, listening to the retrieval threshold parameter. This
		gives you a clear threshold line to compare activations against.</p>
	<br>
	<h3>Save and Playback</h3>
	<p>All of the tracing data that is sent to the IDE can also be sent
		to file. This allows you to playback the model run at a later time.
		This can be really useful for sharing unusual behavior or documenting
		canonical behavior. Tracing in the IDE can also be (relatively) slow,
		particularly for highlighly complex or long running models. In this
		case, it is often desirable to send only to file and playback later.
		The performance benefits can be significant.</p>
	<p>
		If you select to send events to file, you will see a new folder (<em>sessionData</em>)
		in that run's folder. Right clicking on sessionData will give you the
		option for <em>jACT-R</em>-<em>Playback</em>. This will throw you back
		the run perspective, with the first 30s played back.
	</p>
	<p>You can advance the playback using the green play arrow (and
		it's drop-down menu). Because it is often necessary to playback long
		timespans just to reach what you are looking for, the probe viewer
		with actually skip long time spans, making sure to always playback at
		least 30s before your desired time window.</p>

	<h2>Debugging Tools</h2>
	<p>The jACT-R IDE has support for traditional breakpoints,
		specifically production breakpoints. If you switch over the Debug
		perspective, find a production in the editor and hit Ctrl/Cmd-Shift-B,
		you'll mark that production as a breakpoint. Mark terminate-addition
		as a breakpoint in the addition model. If you then launch the model
		via debug (Debug configuration is the same as a run configuration,
		just in debug mode), you will be in the debugging mode. However,
		anytime you debug a model, it starts in a suspended state. Just click
		the play button to resume.</p>
		<img src="images/debugStart.png" width="30%" >
		<p>Once running it will halt once it reaches the terminate-addition. You can use
		the step-over, step-resume, resume tools as you'd expect. If you've got the log,
		confict set, or buffer views in the debug layout, you'll be able to see them update
		as the model hits the breakpoints.</p>
		<img src="images/breakpointReached.png" width="30%" >
		
 <h2>Best Practices</h2>
 <p>If you've been running all of these examples, you probably have a log view with dozens of tabs. It is
 important to remove any traces when you are done, they consume massive amounts of memory. When you're done,
 click the red X in the tab and that will free up that data.</p>
 <p>As you start to accumulate lots of projects, it is often best practice to close any projects that you are
 not actively working on. A closed project has no influence on the workspace, but an open one is automatically
 included when you run models.</p>
